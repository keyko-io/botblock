# ü§ñ BotBlock

Get paid by AI for the content you create!

## ü§î Why?

With the rise of AI, the general public is now aware of it and how much money companies are making/loosing out of it.

_But how do they gather information to keep relevant and up to date?_

AI companies and developers generally make use of web crawlers that get into websites and extract the information that they require for their models.
The most important crawlers out there are `GPTBot` (by OpenAI) and `CCBot` (by Common Crawl).

## ü§∫ How do we fight it?

To disallow crawlers to scrape your site, website's owner must update their `robots.txt` static file. For example, to block `GPTBot` it should have the following:

```
User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /
```

As a good practice, crawlers need to check the `robots.txt` file to know if they are allowed to get their contents or not. Thus, this should stop them from doing so.

> In BotBlock we think that securing your website is important and that it should be super easy to do. **Because of that, we have a tool to add these to your existing `robots.txt` so you don't have to**, you would just use the tool and upload the given `txt`

## üí∏ Is there a way to give them the content but just not for free?

That's when BotBlock comes in. The goal of this product is to enable Content Creators to monetize their content for AI developers.

For that we created our main feature at BotBlock, "unlock". How does it work?

1. Content creators enter the site (at `/unlock/partner`) to partner with us to block the site.
2. Assuming that they already updated their `robots.txt`, user creates a subscription plan that anyone can buy to give access to their bot to the site.
3. After the plan is created, the AI dev/company can enter the site (at `/subscribe`) to see the list of plans and their pricing.
4. The AI dev/company select the site they want to crawl and purchases the subscription.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Okay, so what happens after buying the subscription?

> At the time of writing this step is still under development

After the purchase of the subscription plan, the Content Creator gets notified of it and they will have **7 days** to update their `robots.txt` to allow the AI dev/company do their crawling.

- If the Content Creator doesn't do that, BotBlock will return the money to the AI dev/company.
- Otherwise, BotBlock will send the money to the Content Creator and the AI dev/company will be notified to start their crawling.

# üßë‚Äçüíª Running the repo

The repo consists of 3 packages:

- express
- hardhat
- nextjs

### Express

The express server is there to fetch Content Creator's `robots.txt` and then let our main page retrieve them from there. Express server should be online via an ngrok tunnel on `https://correctly-leading-chicken.ngrok-free.app`, but if it ain't the user should browse to `express` and:

1. Install dependencies (`yarn install`)
2. Start the server (`yarn start`)
3. Go to `RobotsContext.tsx` and change the ngrok url with their localhost + port

### NextJS

The main website was developed using NextJS. To run it locally you can do:

1. Install dependencies (`yarn install`)
2. Add the env variable of `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID` at `.env.local` with your [Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io/) client ID
3. Start the development server (`yarn dev`)
4. Access the site on `localhost:3000` (or following the instructions of the server after starting it).

### Hardhat

You should not need running this side of the project for demo purposes.
